# Preface
Physical fitness, at its core, can be defined as the ability to perform day-to-day activities with ease and without undue exhaustion. Yet, in today’s fast-paced and often overwhelming environment, achieving and maintaining this basic level of fitness has become a significant challenge. Many individuals struggle with fundamental questions—where to begin, what diet to follow, which training approach to adopt, and how to tailor these decisions to their unique health requirements. Unfortunately, misleading advice from unqualified trainers or social media influencers often worsens the situation, especially when individual health conditions are overlooked. For example, a person with knee issues requires a carefully designed strengthening routine rather than a generic workout plan.

FIT AI has been conceptualized to bridge this gap by offering personalized fitness recommendations grounded in user-specific parameters such as age, gender, BMI, and pre-existing health conditions. Unlike traditional systems that rely on standard exercise plans, FIT AI leverages a data-driven, user-centric approach to make fitness both accessible and sustainable. The system has been developed using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Medley.com, which captures gym-related preferences and user behaviors. For model training, Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) was employed, and its performance was benchmarked against baseline models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and conventional neural networks.

This project moves beyond incremental improvements in fitness planning; it fundamentally redefines the process. Rather than offering one-size-fits-all routines, FIT AI adapts to individual circumstances—whether that involves existing medical conditions, available equipment, or lifestyle constraints. The platform focuses on creating hyper-personalized, equipment-aware workout strategies that can be carried out at home with simple tools, such as resistance bands or basic weights, thereby eliminating the dependency on costly gyms.

While many fitness platforms emphasize dietary planning, FIT AI shifts the focus toward health-conscious, equipment-based exercise routines that are intelligent, adaptable, and scientifically validated. In a digital landscape saturated with influencer-driven fitness narratives, FIT AI seeks to empower users with credible, customizable, and sustainable fitness solutions designed to truly meet individual needs.
